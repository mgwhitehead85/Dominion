# Dominion

Use object-oriented programming to reproduce the card game Dominion.

Rules of Dominion can be found here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/dominion/game-rules.php

We had to use Java to read-in a .txt file of cards. Based on these cards and the rules of the game the user inputs the amount of players
and Dominion game should replay just as you would with a normal deck of cards. Players take turns, buy cards, use cards, and coins
are accumulated. A winner is then declared once 3 stacks of card types are empty.

This was a great project as I got to run the entire gamut of Java. From design, read-in, output, linked lists, logic functions,
dealing with exceptions, etc. Really proud how this one turned out.
